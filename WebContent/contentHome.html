Trade is the WebSphere end-to-end benchmark and performance sample application. The new Trade benchmark has been re-designed and developed to cover WebSphere's significantly expanding programming model. This provides a real world workload driving WebSphere's implementation of J2EE 1.4 and Web Services including key WebSphere performance components and features.<BR>
<BR>
Trade's new design spans J2EE 1.4 including the new EJB 2.1 component architecture, Message Driven beans, transactions (1-phase, 2-phase commit) and Web Services (SOAP, WSDL). Trade also highlights key WebSphere performance components such as DynaCache, WebSphere Edge Server and Web Services.<BR>

Overview
The Bluemix Runtime performance benchmark sample provides a suite of IBM developed workloads for 

characterizing performance of the WebSphere Liberty Buildpack. The application are a collection of 

Java classes, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages. This application is meant to be deployed onto 

the cloud, and use services provided by the cloud. At a minimum, a SQLDB service is required.
